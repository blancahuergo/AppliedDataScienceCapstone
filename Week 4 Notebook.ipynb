My model will look at the venues in the neighbourhood in Toronto and the venues in the neighbourhoods in New York to see their similarity in terms of the venues available. Neighbourhoods with similar types of venues will likely have neighbours with similar interests. This will therefore make it more likely for the Canadian businessman to be successful in New York.",
